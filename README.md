# Jose Quintero

Hey! I'm José Quintero, I've been close to a computer since an early age, and been passionate about it ever since.

I build websites, web applications and translating a client’s vision to an actual functional website. With knowledge in technologies such as JavaScript, CSS/Sass HTML5, React js, and others.
